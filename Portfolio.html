        <p> Hello! My name is Kyle Yoon and I am currently a senior in High School living in Southern California. Outside of school I am currently running on the school track team, play two instruments, (guitar and piano), and do other volunteer work for my community. I would consider myself to be a bright, hardworking, positive, and reliable individual that would be a great fit into any new environment that I go to.  The computer science field has recently become an area of great interest and I hope to pursue a career in Data Science/Anayltics.  </p>
